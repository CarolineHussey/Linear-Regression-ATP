# Linear Regression Association of Tennis Professionals
 Project based on Codecademy material.  Data from Association of Tennis Professionals. Data shows game statistics for the top ranked players from 2009 - 2017.

 This project is presented in Jupyter.  I use python, pandas to load and explore data, matplotlib to visualise data and sklearn to perform linear regression.
